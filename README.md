## Project : FLASHING MORSE CODE DECODER

### About This Project : 
> To receive the morse code signal from the morse code flasher by light intensity sensor (GY-30)
> communicate to MATLAB software for signal processing through micro controller unit (arduino)
> and display on GUI on MATLAB App (with expected to have output as text file) 

### Goals (Bullets) :
* **Expected Learning Outcome**
  * Method of Integrating Arduino MCU with MATLAB Software
  * Creating GUI of Application on MATLAB
  * Analog to Digital Signal Processing
* **Arduino Coding**
  * Receiver
    * Arduino Nano 
    * GY-30 Light Intensity Sensor    
  * Encoder ( Morse Signal Flasher )
    * Arduino UNO
    * MJ-010 5v LED
* **MATLAB** 
  * Coding
    * Signal Processing
    * Decoding
  * GUI 
    * Application User Interface

* * *

## Features :
* Receive Morse Code from flashing morse code signal.
* Decode received morse code to text message.
* Export the text message to text file.

## (Forgot to) UPDATE

This project is finished We reduce a scale of work to done only on arduino IDE and drop ot using MATLAB
