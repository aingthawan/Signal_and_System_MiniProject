## Project Draft : Morse code flasher reciver and encoder

### Purpose of The Project
> To receive the morse code signal from the morse code flasher by light intensity sensor (GY-30)
> communicate to MATLAB software for signal processing through micro controller unit (arduino)
> and display on GUI on MATLAB App (with expected to have output as text file) 
> AND 20 MARKS :)
