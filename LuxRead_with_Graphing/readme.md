From Previous work, I already know how to get the value from this i2c device

now, let's show them on the graph 
  
with a little experiment to see how they working with the morse code from the flasher

* * *

- distace from sensor to light flasher : ~25 cm ( Get kinda weird results, when they receive flashing pulse the value is inverse??? )
